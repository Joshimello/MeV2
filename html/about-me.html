            <p>I guess you can call me an extrovert? most of the time I think. Am I a full-time nerd? Not at all! I enjoy music a lot, bass, hiphop, R&B, lofi are some genre that I enjoy. I also practise jazz on the saxophone (not pro). I do love to fabricate consumables, also known as cooking! I'm more on the baking and barista side but anything about food is fun to me. As for sports, I can do fencing, ping pong, volleyball, badminton and a bit of basketball. If you do meet me, know that im a very relaxed person so don't worry too much, but beware I DO BITE.</p>
